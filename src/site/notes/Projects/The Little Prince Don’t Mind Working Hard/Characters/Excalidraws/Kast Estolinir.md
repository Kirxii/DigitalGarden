## <span class='orange'>:LiGrip: Brief Summary</span>

[[Projects/The Little Prince Don’t Mind Working Hard/Characters/Kast Estolinir (Old)\|Prince Kast]], the smart and wise protagonist, dreams of living in a peaceful world, but the world is in constant danger from politics as well as the roaming monsters. Though he can be perceived as “perfect” by outsiders, he deeply fears of failure that he keeps only to himself.

## <span class='orange'>:LiMessageSquareText: Backstory</span>

As the fourth prince of the royal Estolinir family, he is the youngest in the bloodline. Hence, he won't have much chance in inheriting the throne over his brothers, which he realized at just the age of 5. But knowing that won't stop him from trying to live his best, as he also started developing a liking to learning and reading books from the royal library. He was neglected the most in his family, but that doesn't necessarily mean that he lives in isolation, it was rather the opposite. Everyone was still treating nicely to him, but they won't think too highly of his skills since he was still young.

The first breakthrough in his life was when he gained his first magic type at the age of 7, which was the [[Projects/The Little Prince Don’t Mind Working Hard/Magic/Fabric/Fabric\|Fabric]] magic type. It granted him the power to manipulate the properties as well as its movement from the existing fabric around him, but it won't allow him to generate new pieces of fabric. After noticing his extraordinarily rare magic type, his father piqued interests in him, as he started making him practice using his powers for fighting and for increasing his mastery in it.

His prowess doesn't end there, as he received another breakthrough at the age of 11, which was the [[Projects/The Little Prince Don’t Mind Working Hard/Magic/Ice/Ice\|Ice]] magic type. It allowed him to generate ice in different shapes and form, as well as moving any ice near him. The only fallback to that power is that he can still feel cold if the ice he created doesn't have a will to it after he has used it. As he used it for the first time, he realized that both of his powers complement each other quite well, as Ice can be used for offensive attacks and assist him in moving effortlessly, which he needed as he doesn't have as much stamina as his energy. While Fabric can be used to warm him up, as well as grappling to objects, useful for catching something safely.

Of course, his training would still be continued, but he would have started by the age of 10 regardless for his upcoming coming of age party, as well as the Noble Introduction exam. At this point, he got checked on more frequently, as everyone in the castle are worried if his mental health is okay or not, which in most case, was good. He was training with a dummy, as well as with a knight from the kingdom for test fights, and most of his fights came out victorious, even if the knights weren’t holding back.

After he can even confidently beat the knights of the kingdom, his father decided to hire some tutors to refine his fighting style more, which was consisted of just his magic. From there, he learned about the balancing of magicules transformation, as how to use it to his advantage. He can now create cold fogs out of his ice, as well as manipulating fabric from at a distance. Writing notes, as well as try to think of ways to use his magic more ‘unusually’, is now his daily routine.

To balance out his unhealthy amount of working, he usually spends his free time making some new clothing or in the garden. Which his two large wardrobe in his room is full to the brim by the age of 14, as well as there are a myriad of colors in his garden. Before his coming of age party happened, he felt proud of everything he did while he was still so young, as he could be the one who accomplished the most among his peers. High mastery over his magic, excellent fighting capabilities, made a ton of fabric products, as well as grown a small greenhouse in the castle.
